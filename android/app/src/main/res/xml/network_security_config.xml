        Cleartext traffic is permitted globally to support HTTP pairing server
        on dynamic local IP addresses (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 100.x.x.x).

        Android's network security config does not support CIDR notation, so we
        cannot restrict cleartext to only private IP ranges. The alternative
        would be HTTPS for pairing, but that adds UX complexity.

        Security note: The actual sync protocol uses mTLS over gRPC, which
        provides strong security. The HTTP server is only used for initial
        certificate pairing and browser extension communication.
